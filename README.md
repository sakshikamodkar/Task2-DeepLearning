# Task 2: Deep Learning for Image Classification

## Internship
**Organization:** CODTECH  
**Domain:** Data Science  
**Task:** Deep Learning Model Implementation  

---

## Objective
The objective of this task is to implement a **Deep Learning model** for **image classification** using Python and TensorFlow.  
The project demonstrates the complete workflow of a deep learning pipeline, from data loading to model evaluation and visualization.

---

## Dataset
- **Dataset Used:** MNIST (Handwritten Digits)
- **Classes:** Digits from 0 to 9
- **Image Size:** 28 × 28 grayscale images

The MNIST dataset is a standard benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

---

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow (Keras)  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

---

## Workflow
1. Import required libraries  
2. Load the MNIST dataset  
3. Preprocess and normalize image data  
4. Build a deep learning neural network  
5. Compile the model  
6. Train the model  
7. Evaluate model performance  
8. Visualize accuracy and loss  

---

## Results
- Achieved high classification accuracy on the test dataset
- Training and validation performance visualized using graphs
- The model successfully classifies handwritten digits
